"It's of course not what consumerism tells you, but shedding feels good. It's a lightning up. Scheduling pseudoskins, crusted stuff an dead wood. Things that don't work anymore, things that don't keep you alive. Sets of ideas that you've had too long. People that you don't really like to be with, habits of thought, habits of sexuality."

Hillman's put it also  in another way: Growth is always loss. Anytime you're gonna grow, you're gonna lose something. Familiarity, when you begin to move into the unfamiliar...

Wow, stop stop, that's enough loss und unfamiliarity in this crazy world today. I just wanted to be open for something new.
