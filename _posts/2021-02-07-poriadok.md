The only wish for this year was: "The artist shows." Create and share my work, impressions about academy, observations of people. Emotions, after all. The joke "a jeweler without a studio" is no longer a joke. That's why I'm in motion, not in action. Thinking and reading a lot, trying not to lose myself as an artist, at least in theory. 

So I decided to start with the name. I don't like it. No, I'm not refusing identity, origin and love this scary and untranslatable "Ñ‹", that brakes rules. "Rukavitsyna" can be pronounced only in Russian. It is too long and difficult to remember. There is no me in it. I'm tired to spell and be a set of sounds at the end of the list. That's why I'm looking for an artist name. Short, laconic and graphic. A friend of mine proposed "Avits" (ruk Avits yna). Do you think I'm Anna Avits?!
