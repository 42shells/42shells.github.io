Diptych "Point of view". 2020
Point nÂ°1

It was extremely difficult to find inspiration in isolation. However, the search for creativity doesn't go away, so instead of outdoor painting the artist begins to work with a new daily routine. Any contact with the outside world leads to a meeting at the sink. We wash our hands, our dishes, our brushes or palettes. The whole world in one sink. Everyday repetition becomes the main panorama of life. And it should also be drawn.

The work is inspired by photos of @iners_negotium. These sinks from academy I wrote at home. And didn't expect that I would really wash my hands in them in 2021.
